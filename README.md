# AMANA Wallet

This repository contains the code for the AMANA Wallet, a web application that enables users to interact with the AMANA Backend and perform anonymous betting on the [Manifold](https://manifold.markets?referrer=AMANABOT) platform.

The AMANA Wallet is powered by the [RAILGUN](ipns://www.railgun.org/) privacy system, ensuring that all transactions and bets remain completely anonymous.

## Disclaimer

The AMANA Wallet is a for-fun project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Manifold Markets. The AMANA token has no real monetary value and is not exchangeable for real money. The project maintainer, Anton Makiievskyi, is responsible for the AMANA tokens sent to the AMANA account and will honor all legitimate bets, deposits, and withdrawals

## Features

- **Secure Wallet Creation**: Generate a new wallet or import an existing one using a mnemonic phrase. Your private keys are stored securely on your device and never shared with anyone.

- **AMANA Token Management**: Easily convert Mana to AMANA, and back.

- **Anonymous Betting**: Place bets on Manifold markets using AMANA tokens without revealing your identity. The wallet automatically generates fresh redemption addresses for each bet to prevent linkability.

- **Bet History**: View your betting history, including the market, prediction, and outcome, all while maintaining complete privacy.
